**PK Flyer** is a project I've honed in earnest for the past 3 years here in Chicago. The focus of this music has been the process - a way to flip songwriting on its head. 

Building song cycles from a foundation of "found sounds" and meticulously building short conceptual works on top of them. The musical frameworks have been culled from free improvisations, samples of LPs played at 1/2 speed, or sound output from a $5 iphone game. The songs are reverse-engineered from there. The songwriting is more like mining than building, the finished works are strung together with consistent musical and lyrical themes. Pulling in whatever ensembles seem to fit the tone (woodwinds, voices, string quartets, etc), It's a clumsy process that seems periodically ill-conceived even through the initial mixing stages. 

There's a satisfaction that I've found addicting, however. I'd say it's sort of like unfolding an exquisite corpse done in various stages of inebriation, but now that I'm 2 years clean the comparison feels a little less figurative.
