2013's [Man in the Mira](https://pkflyer.bandcamp.com/album/man-in-the-mira) was the first ep recorded as PK Flyer. The songs were written atop the audio output from a musical iphone game called [Musyc](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musyc/id489836689). I was interested in seeing the musical material removed from the "found sounds" that governed the song structure, and arranged them for string quartet. I wanted to confirm that the music stood on it's own and I was glad to see that it did. I think of it as the final step in the process â€“ as opposed to a remix.
