## About Halo Machine

Building on the collage style of past albums, Halo Machine was composed atop 3 separate drones and features guest musicians Emma Hospelhorn ([Ensemble Dal Niente](https://www.dalniente.com/)) and Whitney Johnson ([Matchess](https://matchess.bandcamp.com/)). The songs use religious tropes to explore the meditations and brooding that comes with the monastic rhythms of living alone during lockdown.
