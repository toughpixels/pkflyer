2 songs documenting a gentle breakout of lockdown mindsets, floating lightly on the soft joy of creative collaboration.

1st song is imaginary. 2nd song is about a real town in Illinois where my family went to Church, and my father worked as a welder for a short time on a now decommissioned nuclear power plant on Lake Michigan.

Recorded on January 29th, 2022
