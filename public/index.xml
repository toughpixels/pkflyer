      <description>About This Track Thereâ€™s a presumption that you have to get out of the city to find peace and tranquility, but for me the stretch of Lake St between Ashland and Kedzie has always been a place of respite. You feel at once in the guts of the city and at an observation point. No facades and few people on foot, it&amp;rsquo;s a uniquely sleepy part of town that for me welcomes reflection.</description>

      <description>PK Flyer is a project I&amp;rsquo;ve honed in earnest for the past 3 years here in Chicago. The focus of this music has been the process - a way to flip songwriting on its head.
Building song cycles from a foundation of &amp;ldquo;found sounds&amp;rdquo; and meticulously building short conceptual works on top of them. The musical frameworks have been culled from free improvisations, samples of LPs played at 1/2 speed, or sound output from a $5 iphone game.</description>
