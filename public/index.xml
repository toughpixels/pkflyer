      <description>2 songs documenting a gentle breakout of lockdown mindsets, floating lightly on the soft joy of creative collaboration.&#xA;1st song is imaginary. 2nd song is about a real town in Illinois where my family went to Church, and my father worked as a welder for a short time on a now decommissioned nuclear power plant on Lake Michigan.&#xA;Recorded on January 29th, 2022&#xA;Credits Composed by: Paul Karner Performed by: Emma Hospelhorn, Brian Sulpizio, John Sutton, Andrew Trim, Seth Vanek, and Paul Karner Engineered and mixed by: Drew Durepos &amp;amp; Alex Inglizian Mastered by: Mikey Young </description>

      <description>Halo Machine was composed atop 3 separate drones. The songs use religious tropes to explore the meditations and brooding that comes with the monastic rhythms of living alone during lockdown.&#xA;Liner Notes Halo Machine Just keep scrolling.&#xA;Lake Street Thereâ€™s a presumption that you have to get out of the city to find peace and tranquility, but for me the stretch of Lake St between Ashland and Kedzie has always been a place of respite.</description>
